			<h1>Help Page</h1>
			<p>Here you can find a full list of this site's functionality.</p><hr>
			
		</div>

		<div class="mainList">
			<h3><span class="num">1.</span> We want to know you...</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<p>It is a little funny element, which can print out your name in the greeting part of the page, if you wrote it in the form. Screenshot (it becomes larger if you move mouse on it):</p>
				<div class="imageList">
					<img src="images/help1.png">
				</div><hr>
				<p>However, it's not necessary to answer this question. If you want to keep your name in secret, just press "OK" with blank form! Result:</p>

			<h3><span class="num">2.</span> Slider</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<p>JavaScript controls its moving. Slides are changing with a 3-second interval. But it is not the only thing that can do this slider.</p>
				<h5><span class="num">2.1</span> Move!</h5>
				<div class="imageList">
					<img src="images/help2.png">
				</div><hr>
				<h5><span class="num">2.2</span> Pause it!</h5>
				<p>If you click on the current image, slider will stop and appropriate paragraf will open.</p>
				<div class="imageList">
					<img src="images/help3.png">
				</div><hr>
				<h5><span class="num">2.3</span> Resume it!</h5>
				<p>If you click on this image again, slider will resume and paragraf will close.</p><hr>
				<h5><span class="num">2.4</span> A little bit of CSS!</h5>
				<p>If you move your mouse on description below slider, it will react and change its color. I made it just for fun.</p><hr>
			</div>

			<h3><span class="num">3.</span> Open them all!</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<p>Main text content is hidden here!</p>
				<h5><span class="num">3.1</span> That is it?</h5>
				<p>There are six dropdown elements on this site. You already know, that it can be opened by clicking on appropriate slide. Also you can click on any header, it will do the same.</p>
				<div class="imageList">
					<img src="images/help4.png">
				</div><hr>
				<h5><span class="num">3.2</span> How can I hide it now?</h5>
				<p>Just click on the button "Hide Text" and you will close article. This also works when it was opened from slider: you will close article and resume slider.</p>
				<div class="imageList">
					<img src="images/help3-1.png">
				</div><hr>
				<h5><span class="num">3.3</span> A link?</h5>
				<p>Yes, each article has a ink to the original page wich contain the information provided by this site. Even if it's only a course work, I think, it must be here.</p>

			<h3><span class="num">4.</span> Is everything OK?</h2>
